  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Tired of debugging bad code? Interested in weird programming languages? Curious about using computers for doing math? In this fast-paced not-for-credit class, we'll learn the Lean programming language, which is probably radically different from any other language you've used before. We'll explore some of Lean's powerful features, such as dependent types, type classes, monads, local imperativity, and tactics. Hopefully, this class will give you a fresh new perspective on an alternative way of programming and doing math.

    <b>Prereqs:</b> 6.101 or equivalent, 6.120 or equivalent
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Compared to 6.S057 Verified Software Engineering:</b> 6.S057 uses the Dafny automated theorem prover which has a long history of serious bugs. Don't use Dafny, it's unsound!
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Compared to 6.512 Formal Reasoning About Programs:</b> I haven't actually taken 6.512, but my friend said that class mostly just proves trivial things using Rocq instead of Lean. This class will instead use Mathlib and modern automated tactics like <code>grind</code> to prove some nontrivial theorems too.
